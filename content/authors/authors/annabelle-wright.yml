bio: |
  I am  a software quality champion and LGBTQIA+ advocate.
  I have been at my current role with Xandr since January 2020, where I have led team efforts to redefine how to reduce complexity in the software quality lifecycle.
  I am passionate about reducing the barriers that fellow queer people face in the technology industry and champion multiple efforts to increase workplace inclusiveness.
