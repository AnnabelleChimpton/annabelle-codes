*Work in Progress*
 will keep this post short and sweet, since most of the process that brought this portfolio site together was well documented by other people. I will do my best to periodically update this post as I change and tweak various parts of my site.

This website is built using Gatsby JS with build/deployment through Netlify.

For setting up the front end Gatsby theme, I followed this documentation: https://dev.to/thtmnisamnstr/building-a-portfolio-resume-site-with-gatsby-part-1-setting-up-your-environment-and-creating-a-local-themed-site-aho

For setting up deployment to Netlify on the free tier, I used this documentation: https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/
